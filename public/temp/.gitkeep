/* The .gitkeep file is a way to add an empty directory to a Git repository.
 In Git, directories that don't have any files in them are not tracked by default.
The .gitkeep file is often used as a placeholder to overcome this limitation.

Git doesn’t track empty directories, so if you want to push an empty directory
 to your repository, you can add a .gitkeep file inside that directory.
It’s a convention (the name itself doesn’t trigger any special Git behavior)
used by developers to signal that the directory should be kept in the repository
even if it's empty.
This is particularly useful when you want to maintain a directory structure
for organizational purposes or when a tool or framework expects certain
directories to exist, even if they are initially empty.*/
